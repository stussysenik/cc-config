Generate my engineering journal for today showing what I actually built and accomplished.

Run this command and display the full output:
```bash
python3 ~/Desktop/cc-config/summary.py
```

This shows:
- Projects worked on with timestamps
- Files created and modified
- Tasks completed
- Operations performed (tests, builds, commits)
- Week-at-a-glance activity chart
