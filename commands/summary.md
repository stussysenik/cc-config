Generate my engineering journal for today showing what I actually built and accomplished.

Run this command and display the full output:
```bash
python3 ~/Desktop/cc-config/summary.py
```

This shows a quick dev journal with:
- What shipped per project (product-focused descriptions)
- Vibes: energy, focus, highlight, method, cost
- Week-at-a-glance activity chart

Use `--full` for the verbose output with file lists, task details, top prompts, and engineering principles.
